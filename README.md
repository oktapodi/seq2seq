# LSTM Based Sequence to Sequence Translator to match Utterances to phonemes


The interesting aspect of this project is that in the trainigng data the utterances and phonemes are not aligned and I had to use CTC Loss to account for this non-alignment. It was challenging to implement this and get it working just right but was a lot of fun.
